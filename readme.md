## Git Basics

I was really wondered when understood, that *.md* extension means *markdown* :-)

When I faced the Gihub first time I stucked with problem I didn't understand. That appeared because I listened to recomendation of Github when created repository and added readme.md automatically. Then trying to push commits from my local repository was unsuccessful (a-ha, for sure...) - there already were two repositories with different commit history.
But this case forsed me to understand what's goin on step by step and further learning of git moved easy.

The main new features of git I found in coursera videos were in the ending: `checkout HEAD`, `commit --ammend`, `reset`, `revert`. In the "Git PRO" book the topic about restoring data from history is far from the beginning, despite it's one of the most important thing in the whole version control.

Also in the git training app I've notised the pover of `branch -f` command. Really mightly.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Linux survival seems a bit easy, but at the same moment a bit frustrating. It's not good when you type `cd ~/jokes` and it answers `**wrong**, you should type 'cd jokes' because you're already in home dir. But nevermind, you pass all the same`.

The wholy new thing I found is ability to use printer through the comand line. "Not even a Maybach has this!Â©". Very surprising. Other commands like `cd`, `cp`, `mkdir`, `rm`, etc are useful in combine with git in terminal not only in Linux but in Windows too so I'm sure I will use them permenently.

In the first part of article about HTTP I found that protocol vesion 2.0 uses parallel requests. Also I didn't see most of response codes before. For sure the information about REST API will be nessessary when I will have deal with client-server interactions, use fetch or probably node.js + ExpressJS (in case of working in back-end).

The topic of multiple resourse caching (on user's machine, on the proxy) and checks is wholy new for me. The article tells about basic things but they are inevitable for proseeding to more special themes such as security policies implementation.

## Git Collaboration

This part was interesting and sometimes challenging. The very surprising moment was that branches are only some kind on pointers which can be moved, switched between each other, etc. Also commits can be copied and disposed at any will. But I have a feeling that unlike the ordinary git flow with cycle of branching, pulling and pushing, these crazy commits-history deconstruction can bring chaos and misunderstanding. If some conditions will force me to use `cherry-pick` and things, I would do it with extremely caution.

Another new thing is that remote branches in fact are local too. They only show the state of data in remote repository. Working alone I would prefer to use `merge` than `rebase`. And pushing in style `push origin main:feature` also looks dangerous.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

Both video-course, or Code academy excersises present basic information about html tags and css selectors. This facts for sure I will use in future work, but I must say francly, they are not new for me except a couple of trifles. 

I'm pretty confused that nobody even remember about css table layout (do not mix up with html table tag!) as if it have never exist. I've read about this layout in the Head First series book and since have never meet it again. Nevertheless we have now flexbox and grid, so there no need in that old layout already - even floats now are almost useless, as I guess.

The interesting method of layout is using 12-columns grid. I haven't used it before, but want to, because it look like be able to solve problems of making page adaptive without tons of media-queries.

Also I've found some new html attributes and tags in html forms. This topic is immense and i still haven't mastered it despite that it's one of the most important things in html.

## Responsive Web Design

Flexbox was already known for me but css grid, on the conrary, was completly new. The fresh useful feature I found among flexbox properties is `align-content` which is good if you don't want to have excess space between the rows.

Grid is looks like the history completed the full turn and came back to the beginning but on the higher level. After the domination of fluid designs we again trying to use best practices of paper typography. I don't think that css grid is universal tool, but i'm going to use it very often. Also it's interesting for me to make some experiments and try in action such properties as `auto`, `fit-content()` and `grid-auto-flow: dense` in combination. I was surprised that css grid can automatically change tracks' sizes, but not only to render them from predefined proportion.

## JS Basics

While I'm taking Kottans course I read learn.javascript at the same time. That's why I met on freecodecamp and in coursera's videos familiar things. But I wish to list the things, I've learned in general and didn't know before.

Earlier I usually used very fundamental things from classical structural programming: if...else, switch...case, cycles, arrays, functions, objects - stuff which is presented in every programming language. Now I've got to my toolkit a lot of built-in methods: for the first for the arrays, strings and objects. Also destructuring assignment and rest arguments are very handy and allow to write code more quickly. Arrow functions are funny, functions, which return functions, look very powerful. I'm trying to use these instruments everytime it seems to me that they will make code shorter and clearer.

But sometimes I see examples of code that in tutorials are described as more readable, but I wouldn't describe them so too. Furthermore I wouldn't even guess that this way of coding is more readable. For instance recursion is not for me more clear than a loop.

The most intrigue object type I've met is a hashmap. O(1) for search is awesome. Looking for examples of use now :-)

## DOM

The last part of algorithm tasks on freecodecamp was very tricky. I've met again with regular expressions - very interesting and useful topic. When I will have a free time, I definitelly will dedicate it to their studing. 
DOM maipulations were familiar for me. As I saw this operations are usually separated from core logic of applications. It's interesting, how is it implemented in frameworks - does they practice manipulate DOM objects directly?

## Object Oriented JS

Video about classes is clear and interesting. But it's important to be careful, as there may be a false confidence in understanding the mechanism of prototypes and its interaction with the constructor. To consolidate, it is advisable to delve into learn.javascript or something similar. Interestingly, classes have essentially limited what was previously possible with constructor functions and their prototype property (which is not at all the same as the hidden \[Prototype\] property!). Previously, it was possible to make another instance the prototype of one instance. Of course, this is fraught with consequences, so now prototypes are nameless objects that inherit from each other. Class methods are immediately sent to prototypes, while properties are passed by value to each instance (so you can't change a property in one instance and change it in all the others at the same time, since it was actually in the prototype).

Codewars is an interesting site. For a long time, I thought that this kind of exercise is pretty useless, since in real development, few people deal with the millionth Fibonacci number and calculating the factorial of a thousand. But now I realized that they are very important for beginners, as they allow you to train in algorithmic thinking, in building an order of actions in your mind, in keeping sequences of what will happen in memory. And the tasks of complex levels allow you to see some of the problems that specialists face - what concerns cryptography, artificial intelligence, linear programming, and performance. By the way, the Eolimp system contains a similar database of tasks (I donât know if Javascript is available there in the list of languages), but the easiest ones are at the level of 5-6 kyu on Codewars. Perhaps a high difficulty is not very good for beginners, but after it the problems of 7-8 kyu are not interesting at all.

And now, here's my profile: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/daniil-bodryagin)

## OOP exercise (A Tiny JS World 2)

When I read about OOP I always see something about three principles - inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism - but almost nothing about object relationships - composition, aggregation, association. As I see the "intuitive" suggestions about how to find out where should we use composition and where inheritance are almost useless. We too often have deal with the problem of diamond inheritance, any-to-many relationships. Classes appearing allowed to bring into JavaScript the approach from languages with classical OOP tradition. But there is still chaos here. Old syntax lets to do some things which classes doesn't and that's why I cannot find the **main, correct** way to work with objects - idiomatic, from best practice and with good performance. 

Inheritance is suffering of need for rebuilding class hierarchy if you suddenly need to cross the parallel branches. The suggestion to prefer composition over inheritance leads to memory devouring because of copying methods to all instances. Also there is mixin approach to implement multiple inheritance. Clean instruction how to write code which will not be weird is totally absent.

Examples in articles show some snippets which look trickily. Sometimes I thought that it was because they were only illustrations for novices and didn't use sophisticated language abilities intentionally, having assumed that readers couldn't know them. But now I begin to suspect that they are fragments of real working code.

However, reading some articles from the short list is not enough to build representation of relationships between constructor, prototype and instance. I had `learn.javascript` behind me, and it helped. Maybe there are some other guides which expound the problem fundamentally. In any case it's necessary to get ready to spend a time to figure out everything.

Despite that I think I've read a lot about the topic and investigated by myself with console how constructors and prototypes work, insights occur periodically. While reading I've understood that `super` called in class constructor calls it's prototype - parent class constructor. And super called in method described in prototype applies to prototype's prototype. I've knew about this parallel inheritance prototype from prototype, constructor from constructor, but now the vision gets together.

Reading about SOLID I wished not just principles describing - this is present everywhere. I wish to get explaining the exact problems which are solving by each of them (the more of them is the best), the problems which appear if principles are not satisfied. After all to understand how to write good code you should know how **must not** to write code because it would become very difficult to maintain.

## Offline Web Applications

It was wonderful. This course may be considered as facile. It's indeed tells just about several methods and doesn't allow you to master service workers, cache and indexedDB on professional level. But nontheless it introduces great instruments in very short time. I've been surprised how many powerful things I can do with javascript: manual driving and redirecting the network requests, manual  filling and freeng the browser cache and even special database on the client side. I don't imagine exactly when and how is this stuff usualy used in real development but I'm sure all of it will be.
