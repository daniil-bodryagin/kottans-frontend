## Git Basics

I was really wondered when understood, that *.md* extension means *markdown* :-)
When I faced the Gihub first time I stucked with problem I didn't understand. That appeared because I listened to recomendation of Github when created repository and added readme.md automatically. Then trying to push commits from my local repository was unsuccessful (a-ha, for sure...) - there already were two repositories with different commit history.
But this case forsed me to understand what's goin on step by step and further learning of git moved easy.
The main new features of git I found in coursera videos were in the ending: `checkout HEAD`, `commit --ammend`, `reset`, `revert`. In the "Git PRO" book the topic about restoring data from history is far from the beginning, despite it's one of the most important thing in the whole version control.
Also in the git training app I've notised the pover of `branch -f` command. Really mightly.
